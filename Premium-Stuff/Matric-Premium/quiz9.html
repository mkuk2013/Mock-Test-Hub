<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, also known as A.Q. Khan, was one of Pakistan's most renowned scientists and is widely regarded as the father of Pakistan's nuclear program. Born in Bhopal, India in 1936, he migrated to Pakistan after the partition in 1947. After completing his studies in metallurgy in Europe, he returned to Pakistan with a strong desire to serve his country.

In the 1970s, after the Indian nuclear test in 1974, Dr. A.Q. Khan offered his services to the Pakistani government. With his efforts and leadership, Pakistan made rapid progress in nuclear science. In 1998, Pakistan successfully conducted its own nuclear tests in Chagai, Balochistan, becoming the seventh nuclear power in the world and the first in the Islamic world. This achievement was a result of years of hard work by Dr. Khan and his dedicated team of scientists.

Apart from his scientific achievements, Dr. Khan was also a strong advocate for education. He established many educational and research institutions to help students, especially in science and engineering. Though later in life he faced controversy regarding nuclear proliferation, many Pakistanis still remember him as a national hero who helped strengthen the defense of the country. Dr. A.Q. Khan passed away in October 2021, but his contributions to Pakistan's security and scientific development remain unforgettable.
